LiveReload is a tool that automatically refreshes your webpage once you make changes in your code editor. No more F5 or Ctrl+R :)

Let's install it for Windows, but you can also use it in OSx and Linux.

1.  Go to [http://livereload.com/](http://livereload.com/)
2. Scroll down to Windows link and download the program
3. Install and run it
4. In the top left corner of LiveReload window click ***add***
5. Select your project foloder. (This folder now will be watched for changes by the program)
6. Go to [http://livereload.com/extensions/](http://livereload.com/extensions/) and install the extension for your browser
7. In Chrome, go to ***Manage Extensions*** and enable *Allow access to file URLs*
8. You should now have a LiveReload icon in your browser extensions panel
9. Click it to enable and watch the magic. Open an HTML file in your project. Once you make a change in your code editor and save, the page will refresh automatically
