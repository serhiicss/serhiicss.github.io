<p><strong>I have completed</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHE2RsdyUNpbiVn-cfuV7Fos">Learning Gulp</a> by LevelUpTuts. The course consists of 11 lessons and has taught me to install and setup Gulp plugins.</p>

<p>I have also taken the <a href='https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/14-days-to-learn-sass'>14 Days to Learn Sass</a> course. This course helped me to grasp fundamentals of SASS directives such as @while. Afterwards I was able to build this. </p>

<p>My logo has been redesigned. It is now nearly what I had in mind, but still not exact. Perhaps, when I can afford a designer, I will have one design me a logo. But here it is</p>
<img src="/assets/img/logo.png" width="64px" alt="Serhii.css Logo">

<p>I turned 3 PSDs into code and now I have a page to show my work. I should try and code at least 1 PSD a week for practice.</p>

What else I learned:

<ul>
<li>Instead of using Reset or Normalize, just use needed modules.
</li>
<li>jQuery has a migrate plugin for new versions, but some libraries do not work still.</li>
<li>Touch friendly buttons must be between 25px and 35px in height</li>
</ul>
