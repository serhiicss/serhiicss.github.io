<p><strong>Due to unforeseen</strong> events I wasn't been able to learn or practice web development for nearly half a year. But now I am back!  
  </p>
<p>First of all, now I am using <a href="https://toggl.com/">https://toggl.com/</a> to track time spent on learning new things. There is a report in the end of this post.
  </p>
<p>This time I have decided not to code until I feel comfortable enough. Instead I went through a bunch of basic web-dev videos to refresh my memory. Then I watched some more advanced ones and learned a few things.
  </p>
