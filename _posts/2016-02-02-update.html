<p><strong>End of Janâ€¦</strong> I am being lazy this month. Not much I have done. I am struggling to come up with a clean project template and I am now stuck on typography.</p>
<p>I read <a href="https://ia.net/know-how/responsive-typography-the-basics">Responsive Typography: The Basics</a></p>
<p>and learnt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serif typeface can be used for web if it is above 12px in size.</li>
<li>To hold a well-printed book at a comfortable reading distance while looking at your website to compare.</li>
</ul>
<p>I read <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography">http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography</a></p>
  <ul>
<li> And learnt that each project requires custom typography and there is no really a golden rule for all the projects.</li>
<li>This is something to keep in mind though <a href="http://www.modularscale.com/">http://www.modularscale.com/</a></li>
<li>Use the 1:1.618 golden section as a rule of thumb</li>
</ul>
<p>I am beginning to understand what Gulp and Grunt are for. Will learn to use these tools soon.</p>
