<p>LiveReload is a tool that automatically refreshes your webpage once changes are made in your code editor.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s install it for Windows, but you can also use it in OSx and Linux.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://livereload.com/">livereload.com</a></li>
<li>Scroll down to Windows link and download the program</li>
<li>Install and run it</li>
<li>In the top left corner of LiveReload window click <strong><em>add</em></strong></li>
<li>Select your project foloder. (This folder now will be watched for changes by the program)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://livereload.com/extensions/">livereload.com/extensions</a> and install the extension for your browser</li>
<li>In Chrome, go to <strong><em>Manage Extensions</em></strong> and enable <em>Allow access to file URLs</em></li>
<li>You should now have a LiveReload icon in your browser extensions panel</li>
<li>Click it to enable and watch the magic. Open an HTML file in your project. Once you make a change in your code editor and save, the page will refresh automatically</li>
</ol>

<p>Update: It seems that the Firefox extension does not work. I found another way to auto reload and I now use it with Firefox Developer Edition. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-reload/?src=api">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-reload/?src=api</a></p>
