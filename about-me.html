					<h2>More about me</h2>
					<p>I am an honest and hard working person who is always dedicated to any given task. I love working with people on various projects, getting to know each other and inspire each other. My weakens is probably my perfectionism. I may spend extra time to carry things to perfection. I normally demonstrate strong determination, enthusiasm and trustworthiness. I am not afraid to take charge when needed and I am comfortable with delegating to others.</p>
					<p>In my spare time I like to run, hike, take pictures, watch movies and go fishing. I watch soccer games (go Barca!) and F1 championship. Best of all though, I like having a drink near a fireplace in a company of interesting people.</p>
